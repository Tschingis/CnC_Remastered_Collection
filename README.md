# CnC_Remastered_Collection

This is a fork of CnC_Remastered_Collection which is used to improve path planning in the game.
The mod uses a dijstrak path finding algorithm to do path planning. Since threat handling was integrated in the old path planning algorithm,
which could not be reproduced 100% (mainly because of understanding the old game logic), some missions might be harder or easier :).
